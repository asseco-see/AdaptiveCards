| Angular Services (Http, Interceptors, Pipes, Localization, Sanitizer)    | Merge not possible with Adaptive Card renderer                                                                                                     | Already included in tools (studio, designer, vscode extension)   | CSS, HTML and TS all part of same component file                    |
| Possibility of rendering existing components                             | Existing utilities must be rewritten (AOT compatible)                                                                                              | Components already implemented                                   | Components cannot be used outside of adaptive card as NativeElement |
